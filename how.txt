- Setup the database
python manage.py migrate

- Start a Celery worker service (specify your Django project name):
celery -A [project-name] worker --loglevel=info

- Also, as an alternative, you can run the two steps above (worker and beat services) with only one command (recommended for development environment only):
celery -A [project-name] worker --beat --scheduler django --loglevel=info

Also you can add and manage your periodic tasks from the Django Admin interface.
